## About the Project

"Guess The Flag" is a delightful SwiftUI app that challenges users to identify flags from different countries. Developed as part of the Day 20 challenge in the "Hacking with Swift" course, this project covers fundamental SwiftUI concepts, including the use of stacks, images, gradients, buttons, and alert messages. The game keeps track of the user's score, providing an interactive and engaging experience.

### Features

- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the user's score and displays it throughout the game.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes SwiftUI's layout capabilities for a consistent and adaptive user interface.
- **Dynamic UI Effects:** Incorporates animations, rotations, and scaling for interactive and visually appealing gameplay.

### Learning Highlights

This project introduces core SwiftUI concepts, including:
- **Button Interactivity:** Implements interactive buttons for user input, with dynamic effects on correct and incorrect answers.
- **Alert Messages:** Displays alert messages to provide feedback on user performance.
- **Colors and Gradients:** Utilizes LinearGradient to create visually appealing color gradients for the background.

# Day 20 Challenge Overview

## Project 2, Part 1

How did you find yesterday’s challenge day? Unless you’re an undiscovered programming prodigy there’s a good chance you made a few mistakes along the way, and there’s even a good chance your app still has a couple of bugs in that you might not have noticed yet.

And you know what? That’s OK. Donald Knuth – computer science professor emeritus at Stanford – once wrote, “beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.” And if even Donald Knuth warns people of potential bugs, I think it’s OK if we have a few of our own.

Today we’re moving onto our second project, so it’s back to the overview day so we can look at some new SwiftUI techniques. It’s another easy project, but you’ll be learning so many core SwiftUI techniques that you’ll be using for years to come.

### Topics Covered:
1. Using stacks to arrange views
2. Colors and frames
3. Gradients
4. Buttons and images
5. Showing alert messages

Once you’ve made it through those topics, make sure and post your progress somewhere online.
